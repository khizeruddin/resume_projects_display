# resume_projects_display
Here I show all my public projects, that I have worked on to upskill myself and learn new stuff. Mostly Data Science projects, Machine learning algorithms and development projects. These projects are present in resume/CV, and are here for display in detail.
## Projects
1. [Project 1: Scrap Predicting in Tire Production - Machine Learning](Project1/README.md)
   - Tools: Python, Google Colab, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Neural Networks, Tableau, PowerBI
2. [Project 2: Forecasting and understanding the types of Steel and its materials, dimensions, variations, Faults and Errors - Machine Learning](Project2/README.md)
   - Tools: Python, Google Colab, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, TensorFlow, Neural Networks, Tableau, PowerBI
3. [Project 3: Other Data science and Machine Learning projets on ](Project2/README.md)
   - Tools: Python, Google Colab, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression, Decision Tree, TensorFlow, Neural Networks, Tableau, PowerBI
